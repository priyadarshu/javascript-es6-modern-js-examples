/**
 'var' keyword was being used to declare the variables,
 with es6 -> 2 new keywords have been introduced, "const" and "let".

 const -> to declare the constant values, i.e. the values remain fixed and will not
 change in future, these are really helpful when we work with state management.

 let -> it works similar to var, it accepts values of different data types,
 though the values during initialization, must be with the data type in 
 which the variable has been declared.
 like you can't assign a string value to a variable declared with some other
 data type other than string

 Check out the below examples for more clarity.
